# Lead Scoring System

## Overview
The Lead Scoring System is a machine learning-powered application designed to help blue-collar service businesses rank potential leads based on their likelihood of conversion. By leveraging historical data, this tool allows businesses to prioritize leads more effectively, allocate resources efficiently, and increase their conversion rates.

## Key Features
- **Predictive Scoring**: Assigns a score to each lead based on their likelihood of conversion.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A Streamlit-based web application for real-time lead scoring and visualization.
- **Customizable Model**: Uses Scikit-learn and XGBoost for building and tuning predictive models.
- **Data-Driven Insights**: Provides actionable insights to improve lead management strategies.

    ```

---

## Usage
1. Launch the application by running the command:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
2. Upload a CSV file containing lead data.
3. View the scored leads and export the results for further analysis.

## Model Details
The lead scoring model is a supervised learning model trained on historical lead data. It uses features such as:
- Demographics (e.g., age, location)
- Interaction history (e.g., email opens, website visits)
- Service preferences

### Algorithm
- **XGBoost**: For its robust performance on tabular data.
- **Scikit-learn Pipelines**: For preprocessing and feature engineering.

### Evaluation Metrics
- **Accuracy**
- **Precision/Recall**
- **F1-Score**
- **AUC-ROC Curve**

---

## Data Requirements
The input data should be a CSV file with the following structure:
- **Required Columns**:
  - `LeadID`: Unique identifier for the lead
  - `Demographics`: Information about the lead (e.g., age, location)
  - `InteractionHistory`: Engagement metrics (e.g., clicks, website visits)
  - `Outcome`: (Optional) Conversion outcome for model training

### Example Dataset
| LeadID | Age | Location   | Clicks | WebsiteVisits | Outcome |
|--------|-----|------------|--------|---------------|---------|
| 001    | 34  | San Diego  | 5      | 12            | 1       |
| 002    | 29  | Riverside  | 2      | 8             | 0       |

---

## Customization
1. **Training a New Model**:
   - Modify the `train_model.py` script to include additional features or algorithms.
   - Train the model:
     ```bash
     python models/train_model.py
     ```
   - Save the new model to the `models/` directory.

2. **Streamlit Application**:
   - Customize the layout in `app.py`.
   - Add new visualizations using Matplotlib or Seaborn.
